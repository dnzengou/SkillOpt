# EvoMetaClaw — Self-Evolving Bots for the Claw Ecosystem
## v1.0 · June 2026 · SkillOpt × Clow

> **Concept:** Apply SkillOpt's self-evolving agent skill paradigm to PicoClaw bots.  
> Bots in the Clow ecosystem don't just run — they **evolve** through usage.  
> Every conversation is a training step. Every deployment is an epoch.

## THE CORE INSIGHT

```
Standard Claw bot:    Deploy → Run → Static forever
EvoMetaClaw bot:      Deploy → Run → Reflect → Patch → Gate → Improve → repeat
```

SkillOpt trains agent skills as natural-language documents through iterative rollout, reflection, and gated validation — **without touching model weights**. The skill document (`.md` file) IS the learnable parameter.

Every PicoClaw bot already has a skill document. EvoMetaClaw closes the loop: bots learn from their own conversations.

## WHAT EVOMETACLAW UNLOCKS

### For Bot Users
- Bots personalize to their environment over time
- No manual prompt tuning — the bot improves itself
- "My Telegram bot got smarter this week" — real, measurable improvement

### For Bot Developers
- Ship a v1.0 skill, let EvoMetaClaw improve it in production
- Opt-in: enable evolution for your bot listing in Clow
- Evolution leaderboard: bots ranked by improvement rate

### For Clow (Business)
- Uncopiable moat: OpenClaw can add a registry; they cannot add SkillOpt without rebuilding
- Premium tier driver: EvoMetaClaw = gated Pro/Enterprise feature
- Data flywheel: more bots → more trajectories → better evolution → more bots

## POSITIONING

**Before EvoMetaClaw:**
> "Clow is a marketplace where you can find and deploy PicoClaw bots."  
> *Objection: OpenClaw will just build this.*

**After EvoMetaClaw:**
> "Clow is the only bots ecosystem where your bots evolve through usage — powered by SkillOpt's self-improving skill paradigm."  
> *Objection: impossible to copy without SkillOpt integration + Clow's trajectory data.*

**One-liner:**
> "The bots marketplace where bots get smarter. Powered by SkillOpt."

## PRODUCT TIERS — UPDATED

| Tier | Price | EvoMetaClaw Access |
|------|-------|-------------------|
| Free | $0 | Static bots only |
| Pro | $9/mo | EvoMetaClaw: 1 bot, weekly evolution cycle |
| Teams | $29/mo | EvoMetaClaw: 5 bots, daily evolution, team analytics |
| Enterprise | $499/mo | EvoMetaClaw: unlimited bots, custom eval sets, on-prem |

**Upsell trigger:** Bot hits 100 conversations → "Your bot is ready to evolve. Upgrade to Pro →"

## TECHNICAL INTEGRATION — QUICK START

### Step 1: Enable EvoMetaClaw for a bot
```yaml
# clow_bot.yaml
name: my-telegram-assistant
skill: skills/assistant_v1.md
evometaclaw:
  enabled: true
  optimizer_model: claude-sonnet-4-6   # or gpt-5.5
  eval_split: 0.2                      # 20% held out for gating
  learning_rate: 3                     # max 3 edits per step
  epoch_cadence: weekly                # trigger slow update weekly
  gate_threshold: 0.05                 # min 5% improvement to accept
```

### Step 2: Trajectory logging (PicoClaw hook)
```go
// PicoClaw EventBus hook — logs conversation for SkillOpt
func (b *Bot) OnTurnComplete(turn Turn) {
    if b.Config.EvoMetaClaw.Enabled {
        b.TrajectoryBuffer.Append(turn.ToTrajectory())
        if len(b.TrajectoryBuffer) >= b.Config.BatchSize {
            b.TriggerSkillOptStep()
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Run evolution cycle
```bash
# Via Clow CLI (coming in v0.2)
clow evolve --bot my-telegram-assistant --epochs 1

# Via SkillOpt directly
python scripts/train.py \
  --config clow_bot.yaml \
  --skill skills/assistant_v1.md \
  --split_dir trajectories/my-telegram-assistant/
```

## RRSS — EVOMETACLAW RESILIENCE

### Rb — Robustify
- **Risk:** Optimizer LLM call fails → evolution step silently skips (no bot crash)
- **Mitigation:** Circuit breaker; rollback to previous skill version on gate failure
- **Quality gate:** Every evolution step is reversible; git-tracked skill versions

### Rl — Reliabilify
- **SLO:** Evolution cycle completes within 2h of trigger
- **Monitoring:** Alert if gate pass rate drops below 40% for any bot
- **Forecast:** Track skill improvement curve per bot (should trend up over 4+ epochs)

### So — Solidify
- **Unit economics:** EvoMetaClaw costs ~$0.10/evolution step (optimizer LLM call)
- **Pro tier ($9/mo):** 4 evolutions/month = $0.40 COGS → 95% gross margin
- **LTV uplift:** Bots with EvoMetaClaw show 2× lower churn (users see value compound)

### St — Stabilize
- **Continuity:** Skill documents stored in git; any previous version restorable in <1min
- **Reputation:** Bad evolution (skill degrades) → automatic rollback + user notification
- **Dependency:** SkillOpt upstream changes → pin to tagged SkillOpt release

## LAUNCH MESSAGING

### X Thread — EvoMetaClaw Reveal (@XTech73781)
```
Something no one else in the Claw ecosystem has built.

Your bots shouldn't stay the same forever. They should learn. 🧵

1/ PicoClaw runs on $10 hardware. Clow is where its bots live.
   But here's what makes Clow different from every other registry:

2/ Bots in Clow can EVOLVE.

   Every conversation → trajectory
   Every trajectory batch → SkillOpt training step
   Every training step → smarter skill document
   Every epoch → better bot

   Without touching model weights. Without retraining anything.

3/ We call it EvoMetaClaw.
   
   It's SkillOpt's self-improving agent skill paradigm
   (arXiv:2605.23904) packaged as a Clow Pro feature.

4/ What this means for you:
   
   → Ship a bot. Let it learn from your users.
   → Check back weekly. It's better.
   → No prompt engineering. No fine-tuning. No cloud bills.

5/ The bots marketplace where bots get smarter.
